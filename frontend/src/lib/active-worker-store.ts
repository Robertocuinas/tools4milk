/**
 * Active worker store — local/experimental mode for worker selection.
 *
 * This store holds the currently selected "worker" (empleado) for the session.
 * It is PURELY LOCAL — not persisted to the backend, not used for real auth.
 *
 * Purpose: Preview how the app would behave if the current user is operating
 * as a specific employee, before backend implements user↔employee linking.
 *
 * TODO (Phase 13): When backend exposes POST /auth/select-worker or similar,
 * replace this local store with a real server-side session capability.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const { worker, setWorker, clearWorker } = useActiveWorkerStore();
